### Hello. Welcome to my very first project using Java. 

### What this program do?
#### This program is like a game. You start off as a player which has Health, Damage, Bonus damage. You as the player must defeat an enemy (A.I) that has all the same variables as the player.

### Rounds
#### You as the player will start to attack / damage the enemy (A.I). Each will have a chance to attack one another.

### My plan for the future
#### My plan for the project is to add more features such as a revival state for the enemy (A.I) and for the player.
 
If you have any suggestion / feedback, you can email me at clarencekaiwen@gmail.com.
